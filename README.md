## Abstract

In this work, we introduced a Colored Timed Petri Net (CTPN)-based model for intersection management. Leveraging the expressiveness of the CTPN-based model, we can consider timing, vehicle-specific information, and different types of vehicles. We then design deadlock-free policies and guarantee deadlock-freeness for intersection management. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on CTPN-based deadlock analysis and prevention for intersection management.
